Iâ€™m a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a foundational background in computer networks and cybersecurity, holding a Bachelor's degree and CompTIA Security+ certification. I continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay ahead in the ever-growing cybersecurity field.

My passion for understanding and configuring technology has driven me to pursue a career in cybersecurity. I am eager to transition into the field, with the goal of securing a position as a Tier 1 Security Analyst or Compliance (GRC) Analyst. Through this GitHub, I aim to document my ongoing learning projects and showcase my continuous growth in the cybersecurity domain.
